Reduced and mixed precision factorization algorithms.

This repository contains an efficient implementation of various LU
factorization algorithms for NVIDIA GPU devices. In particular, some
of these algorithms are capable of exploiting the mixed precision
floating point units Tensor Cores available on Volta and Turing
architectures.
